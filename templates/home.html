		<p id='intro-blurb'>The EventDoc System is a comprehensive package that gives the users the recording application, device with application pre-installed, and all other necessary infrastructure to fully record a cardiac arrest event.  This holistic system is the future for hostipal record keeping and immediate patient information retrival.  During a Code Blue there is always hectic activity and the old style pen and paper recording only hampers the process of gathering the appropriate data needed for not only for the patients immediate future, but future patient safety as well.

		<p>EventDoc arose from the need to have a system to record the procedures performed upon attempting to recesitate a patient in a hospital.  As you can see from the data above there was a distinct lack of completion of the current paper and pen documentation.  This was extremely distressing for not only are these records used in discorving problems in the current practices, but there is an immediate need for care providers to be able to reference the different procedures and medication used throughout the recesitation process.  All of this pointed toward a system that used the interconnectivity of the internet and was based on a device that allowed instant access without a boot-up process.</p>
